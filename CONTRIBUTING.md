### Contributing features and documentation

* Before contribuing communicate! Check to see if their are open issues about the request. Before adding core features send a message on discord to check if the feature is relevant/needed. The discord is here [TKUCSC Discord](https://discord.gg/bpyCxnR).

* Run tests on your local build!
